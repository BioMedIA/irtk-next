The Image Registration Toolkit (IRTK)
=====================================

The IRTK is a research-focused image processing toolkit, developed and used by the [BioMedIA](https://biomedia.doc.ic.ac.uk/) research group. It provides a collection of libraries and command-line tools to assist in processing and analysing imaging data.

Installation
------------
The IRTK requires [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to build the binaries and [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/) to generate the documentation. Please read the accompanying [installation instructions](INSTALL.md) for a step-by-step guide and a list of required and optional dependencies.
