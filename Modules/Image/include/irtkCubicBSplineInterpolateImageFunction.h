/**
 * Cubic B-spline interpolation of generic image
 *
 * Note that the coefficient, i.e., input voxel type may also be a vector
 * type such as irtkVector3D in particular. This is required by the B-spline
 * free-form transformations. If the input image contains the cubic B-spline
 * interpolation coefficients already, make sure that the VoxelType template
 * argument matches the voxel type of the input image to avoid an unnecessary
 * copy of the input image. This image function will use the memory of the
 * input image directly to access the coefficients in this case.
